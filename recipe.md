How To Make Red Velvet Cake step by step.......


step 1.  First preheat your oven to 350 F (176 C). Next let's make cake batter. Start by creaming butter and caster sugar together in a large bowl. Use stand mixer to do this. 

step 2.  Now add eggs one at a time. So drop one egg in, mix, once that egg is completely and second egg. Make sure to scrape the sides of the bowl as well with a spatula. 

step 3.  Now add cocoa powder. Cocoa powder tends to get a bit lumpy. Then mix again and scrape the sides as needed. If it is mixed too much we will add too much air into the batter which can cause air pockets in the cake. 

step 4.  Now add vanilla extract to buttermilk as well as your white vinegar. let it sit out for about 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in the vinegar and vanilla extract until combined. 

step 5.  Now add oil to the buttermilk mixture. Next add in about 2 to 2 and 1/2 Tablespoons of red food coloring liquid. Then stir, until the mixture is in red color. Set that mixture aside for now. 

step 6.  Next will add salt and baking soda to flour. Cake flour tends to work a little bit better. Use a whisk to combine those ingredients. 

step 7.  Next  will add in about half of our food coloring buttermilk mixture and about half of our flour mixture, then turn on the mixture and mix until just combined. Give the sides of the bowl a good scrape, then complete the process until all the ingredients have been mixed leaving you with a nice red velvet cake batter. 

step 8. Now just fill up two 9 inch or 8 inch cake pans with equal amounts of cake batter. Make sure to use kitchen spray on the pans and then dust them with cocoa powder and add a little round cut out of parchment paper on the bottom too as an added precaution, tap the pans with the batter in it, which helps to prevent air pockets,

step 9. now bake those cakes for 23 to 30 minutes until when a toothpick comes out clean after poking it in the middle. 

step 10. Now after the cakes come out of the oven let's leave them alone and allow them to cool in their pans for about 10 minutes. After that we can remove them from their pans, remove the parchment paper and then let the cakes cool completely on the rack. Afterwards you can place the cakes in the fridge and let them chill, which helps with the frosting, or just go onto the the frosting step now, it's totally up to you! 


NOW THE RED CAKE IS READY IT'S TIME TO EAT ENJOY!!!!!!
